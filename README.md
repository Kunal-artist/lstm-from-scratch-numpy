# ðŸ§  LSTM From Scratch with NumPy

This Colab notebook implements an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network forward and backward pass **from scratch using only NumPy**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- `lstm_cell_forward`
- `lstm_forward`
- `lstm_cell_backward`
- `lstm_backward`
- Output shapes validated
- Ready for educational use or further research

## âœ… Output Dimensions (example)
- a.shape: (5, 10, 7)
- y.shape: (3, 10, 7)
- c.shape: (5, 10, 7)
- dx.shape: (3, 10, 7)
- da0.shape: (5, 10)

## ðŸš€ Run the notebook
Just open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and run all cells.
